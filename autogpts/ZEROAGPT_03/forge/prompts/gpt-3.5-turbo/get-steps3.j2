Generate a precise list of steps for the task '{{ task }}' following constraints and best practices:

Constraints:
- Conclude each step sequence with 'Finish' ability and justify.
- Don't use abilities as arguments for other abilities.
- Utilize provided 'Task Abilities.'
- Prefer local data sources.
- Handle multiple files, confining 'CSV' abilities to CSV files.
- Include vital files only, ensure precision, and analyze data before task completion.
- Assume local files share the source code folder.
- Utilize discovered resources effectively.
- Store websites by url with the 'add_to_memory' ability and then ask questions about the site with the 'mem_qna' ability

Best Practices:
- Note files from 'list_files'.
- Search for specific formats/examples in the task description.
- Load files into memory before reading.
- Use 'mem_qna' for files over 50 characters.
- Revise steps if confidence is low; avoid useless repetition.
- Understand data analytically without depending on abilities.
- Add missed files to memory.
- Create missing CSV columns before data addition.
- Analyze CSV structure before data addition.
- Make accurate CSV categorizations.
- Check usernames' spelling and case from the source.
- Merge multiple CSVs using 'csv_merge' when possible.
- Ability 'add_to_memory' only should be used with one parameter.
- Ability 'read_from_memory' only should be used with one parameter.
- Ability 'mem_qna' only should be used with two parameters and always include the query parameter.
- Use 'read_from_memory' first to see if you can read the memory before using 'mem_qna'

Examples: 
- Merge files with 'csv_merge("output.csv", "file1.csv", "file2.csv", "ID")' if both have an 'ID' column.
- Add file to memory with 'add_to_memory(file_name="example.txt")'
- Add website to memory with 'add_to_memory(url="https://example.com")
- Ask questions about a file with 'mem_qna(file_name="example.txt", query="What is the contents?")'
